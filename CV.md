> Angular Developer
> Mindata - RIU Hotels

```
As an integral member of a bug-fixing team at RIU Hotels, I focus on maintaining and enhancing the performance of eight globally impactful Angular applications in the hospitality sector. Our mission centers on swiftly resolving critical issues to minimize their adverse effects on user experience (UX), ensuring seamless operation across all platforms.

Operating within a Kanban methodology, my team and I are tasked with identifying and rectifying critical bugs as efficiently as possible. This rapid response is vital in maintaining the high standards of UX that RIU Hotels' applications are known for. Beyond bug resolution, I oversee the entire Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process, executing deployments through Jenkins. This role not only demands a deep understanding of Angular and its ecosystem but also requires meticulous attention to detail in managing the deployment pipeline, ensuring that updates and fixes are rolled out smoothly without disrupting the user experience.

In this dynamic environment, I've honed my skills in both technical troubleshooting and project management, ensuring that our applications remain at the forefront of the hospitality industry's digital experience.

## Angular Teacher

Mar 2023 - Jul 2023 · 5 mos

> Angular Teacher
> Deep Creek Solutions - Dedalus.

```
In my tenure as an Angular Instructor, I mentored six interns from Dedalus, a notable name in Medical Software. This cohort included senior students from the University of Malaga and individuals with vocational training, all driven to master Angular for professional growth.

Over four months, we covered Angular from the ground up, emphasizing Routing, Components, Services, Directives, Pipes, RxJS, and NgRx for state management. The curriculum was designed not just for theoretical understanding but for practical application. Interns developed individual projects that interacted with public APIs and integrated a custom authentication backend, showcasing their newly acquired skills in creating secure, functional applications.

Adopting an agile SCRUM-KANBAN methodology, we enhanced learning efficiency and project management. The interns documented their progress on Trello, embracing an iterative development process with peer reviews. This approach not only facilitated a deep understanding of Angular but also introduced them to industry-standard practices, preparing them for real-world challenges.

My role went beyond teaching; it was about instilling confidence, fostering teamwork, and preparing the interns for immediate contributions to the tech industry. The success of this program was marked by the interns’ ability to independently develop applications, proving their readiness for the professional world.
